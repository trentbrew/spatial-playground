Hi, I'm Trent—a designer/dev building spatial tools for the web.
I came across SOOT while working on my own canvas engine (https://amorphous.brew.build) and felt an immediate overlap in approach.

Your work isn't just novel—it's necessary.
I've spent the last few years leading full-stack teams through similar terrain (Vue 3, WebGL, Tailwind, Node).
I'm especially interested in how SOOT's spaces reorganize meaning—not just files.

If there’s any chance to poke around the platform early, I’d love to.

I came across SOOT.com while working on my own canvas engine (https://amorphous.brew.build) and immediately fell in love with what your team is doing.

I've spent the last few years leading small teams through full-stack projects (Vue 3, WebGL, Tailwind, Node). I spend most of my days heads down building, and I would love to put that energy into building something that feels as alive as thought itself.

If there's any chance to explore the platform early, I'd love to dig in.
