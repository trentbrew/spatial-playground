# SOOT Application Draft

## What interests you about working for this company?

I've been building spatial, canvas-based interfaces before discovering SOOT, and finding your platform felt like discovering kindred spirits. My recent project ([amorphous.brew.build](https://amorphous.brew.build)) explores similar concepts - breaking free from linear constraints to create intuitive spatial environments where content lives naturally.

What excites me most about SOOT is how you're not just building another tool, but fundamentally reimagining how we interact with digital information. The idea of content self-organizing spatially, creating "dream logic" navigation - this resonates deeply with my approach to design and development. I see technology as a medium for crafting experiences that feel alive and responsive to human intuition.

My background spans the exact intersection SOOT operates in: I've led design at Gumbo Media (Vue 3, Nuxt), built scalable spatial applications at Turtle Labs, and consistently focus on performance and fluid interactions. Your tech stack (Vue, WebGL, Canvas) is my comfort zone, but more importantly, your vision aligns with how I believe interfaces should evolve.

I'd love to contribute to making spatial computing feel as natural as thought itself.

## Alternative (even more concise):

I discovered SOOT while building my own spatial canvas engine ([amorphous.brew.build](https://amorphous.brew.build)) - the synchronicity was uncanny. Your vision of breaking free from linear interfaces to create self-organizing, spatial experiences aligns perfectly with my work and philosophy.

As a Vue specialist with deep experience in WebGL/Canvas and performance optimization, I've spent years crafting interfaces that feel alive. At Gumbo Media and Turtle Labs, I've led teams building exactly these kinds of boundary-pushing, spatially-aware applications.

What excites me most is that SOOT isn't just iterating on existing patterns - you're fundamentally reimagining how we relate to digital information. I want to help build that future.
