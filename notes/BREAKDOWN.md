I'll help you implement a multi-canvas system with a canvas management menu. Let me start by understanding the current structure and then build out the necessary components.
Search files...
Now let me look at how the Scene Stats component is positioned and styled:
Read file: src/lib/components/SceneStats.svelte
Now let me check how the canvas store handles persistence and loading:
Ran tool
Now let me check how the canvas is currently loaded and see the Zero adapter:
Read file: src/lib/stores/canvasZeroAdapter.ts
Now let me create a new store for managing multiple canvases:
Now let me create a CanvasSelector component to replace the Scene Stats dropdown:
Now let me update the CanvasViewport component to use the CanvasSelector instead of SceneStats:
Read file: src/lib/components/CanvasViewport.svelte
Now let me find where SceneStats is used in the template and replace it:
Ran tool
Now let me update the canvasStore to integrate with the canvasManager:
Read file: src/lib/stores/canvasStore.svelte.ts
Now let me update the canvasStore to integrate with the canvasManager. First, let me check how the store is initialized:
Read file: src/lib/stores/canvasStore.svelte.ts
Now let me update the CanvasViewport component to integrate with the canvasManager:
Read file: src/lib/components/CanvasViewport.svelte
Now let me update the CanvasViewport to integrate with the canvasManager:
Let me check the canvasManagerStore to see what methods are available:
Read file: src/lib/stores/canvasManagerStore.svelte.ts
I see the issue - there's no `initialize` method. Let me fix the CanvasViewport component:
Let me check what's importing `$app/environment`:
Ran tool
Ran tool
Let me check the canvasManagerStore imports:
Read file: src/lib/stores/canvasManagerStore.svelte.ts
The issue is that the canvasManagerStore is importing from canvasStore.svelte, but it should be canvasStore.svelte.ts. Let me fix that:
Now let me check if canvasStore has the methods we're using:
Ran tool
Ran tool
Good, those methods exist. Now let me update the canvasStore to disable its own persistence when canvasManager is active:
Read file: src/lib/stores/canvasStore.svelte.ts
Now let me update the canvasStore to check if canvasManager is managing persistence:
Now let me update the CanvasViewport to properly wait for canvasManager to load:
Read file: src/lib/components/CanvasViewport.svelte
Let me check if canvasManager is already being loaded somewhere:
Ran tool
I see the issue. The canvasManager is loading automatically when the module is imported, but we need to ensure it's loaded before we check for boxes. Let me update the CanvasViewport to properly handle this:
Let me check what's causing this $app/environment error:
Read file: src/lib/components/CanvasViewport.svelte
The error is about the `$app/environment` import. This is a SvelteKit import that should be available. Let me check if there's an issue with the project configuration:
Read file: tsconfig.json
The tsconfig looks fine. The error might be a false positive from the linter. Let me run the app to see if it works:

```bash
cd /Users/trentbrew/TURTLE/Projects/Sandbox/canvas-engine && npm run dev
```

Let me check if the server is running:

```bash
curl -s http://localhost:5173 | head -20
```

Good, the server is running. Now let me check the browser console for any errors. First, let me fix a potential issue with the canvasManagerStore - it needs to properly handle the isLoading state:
Read file: src/lib/stores/canvasManagerStore.svelte.ts
I see the issue. The canvasManager loads automatically when the module is imported, but it's async. Let me add a proper initialization check:
Now let me add a proper initialization promise:
Now let me add a method to wait for initialization:
Now let me update the CanvasViewport to use this method:
The linter error about `$app/environment` is a false positive. Let me check if the app is working by opening it in the browser:
Ran tool
I see the app is loading. Let me wait a moment for it to fully load:
Ran tool
Great! I can see the canvas selector is working - it shows "Artwork Gallery" in the upper right corner. However, it seems like the canvas is loading existing notes from localStorage instead of the artwork gallery. Let me check the console for any errors:
Ran tool
I can see the issue. The canvas is loading from Zero storage (which has existing notes) instead of showing the artwork gallery. The gallery is being generated (`üñºÔ∏è Generated 45 artwork images`) but then Zero sync is overriding it with the stored nodes.

Let me fix this by ensuring the canvas manager properly handles the initial load:
Read file: src/lib/stores/canvasManagerStore.svelte.ts
I see the issue. The canvasManager is trying to create a default gallery, but Zero is also loading its own data. We need to disable Zero when using the canvas manager. Let me check how Zero is initialized:
Ran tool
I see the issue. Zero is automatically initializing and loading data. We need to prevent Zero from initializing when we're using the canvas manager. Let me update the canvasZeroAdapter to add a way to disable it:
Now let me update the canvasStore to check if Zero is disabled before trying to use it:
Read file: src/lib/stores/canvasStore.svelte.ts
I see the issue. The Zero adapter is subscribing to nodes regardless of whether it's disabled. Let me check where the subscription happens:
Now let me also update the canvasStore to properly handle when Zero is disabled:
Read file: src/lib/stores/canvasStore.svelte.ts
Now let me check where Zero is being used for persistence:
Now let me update the canvasManagerStore to disable Zero when it's active:
Now let me refresh the browser to see if the changes work:
Ran tool
I can see the issue - the canvas is still loading existing notes from Zero instead of showing the artwork gallery. Let me check the console messages:
Ran tool
I'll help you fix the remaining issue where Zero is still loading its data despite being disabled. Let me investigate the problem and implement a solution.
Ran tool
Now let me check how the canvasStore initializes and loads data:
Ran tool
I found the issue! The problem is that even though we disable Zero adapter, the canvasStore is still subscribing to Zero's data. Let me check the exact subscription code:
Read file: src/lib/stores/canvasStore.svelte.ts
Now I see the issue. The Zero subscription is set up at the module level when the file loads, and it only checks `canvasZeroAdapter.isEnabled` at that moment. But the canvas manager disables Zero after this code has already run. Let me check how the canvas manager initializes:
Read file: src/lib/stores/canvasManagerStore.svelte.ts
I found the issue! The problem is that the Zero subscription in `canvasStore.svelte.ts` is set up at the module level (line 188), which runs before the canvas manager has a chance to disable Zero. The check `canvasZeroAdapter.isEnabled` happens only once when the module loads, not dynamically.

Let me fix this by modifying the canvasStore to properly handle the Zero subscription:
Now I need to also fix the issue where Zero is still initializing its data even when canvas manager is present. Let me check the Zero adapter initialization code again:
Read file: src/lib/stores/canvasZeroAdapter.ts
Perfect! I can see that the Zero adapter already has logic to check for canvas manager at initialization (lines 335-342). However, the issue is that this check happens after the Zero subscription is already set up in canvasStore. Let me also add a method to properly clean up the Zero subscription in canvasStore:
Now let me update the canvas manager to properly clean up the Zero subscription when it initializes:
Now let me also fix the localStorage key issue in the setPersistence method - it should be using the correct STORAGE_KEY:
Let me check what the STORAGE_KEY constant is in canvasStore:
Ran tool
Let me check the canvasStore file for its STORAGE_KEY:
Read file: src/lib/stores/canvasStore.svelte.ts
I don't see a STORAGE_KEY constant in canvasStore. Let me check where the localStorage key is used in the save/load methods:
Read file: src/lib/stores/canvasStore.svelte.ts
I see the issue now. The `setPersistence` method is trying to remove the wrong localStorage key. Since canvasStore doesn't use localStorage directly (it uses Zero adapter), we don't need to remove any localStorage key there. Let me fix this:
Now let me check if there's still an issue with the initialization order. Let me look at how the canvas manager is imported in CanvasViewport:
Read file: src/lib/components/CanvasViewport.svelte
Now let me test the application to see if the issue is resolved. Let me run the development server:

```bash
cd /Users/trentbrew/TURTLE/Projects/Sandbox/canvas-engine && npm run dev
```

Let me check if the server is running by looking at the port:

```bash
lsof -i :5173
```

Good, the server is running. Now let me check the browser console to see if there are any errors. Let me also add some debug logging to better understand the initialization order:
Now let me also add debug logging to the canvasStore to see when Zero subscription is set up:
Now let me check where setupZeroSubscription is called:
Ran tool
Let me check where line 249 is:
Read file: src/lib/stores/canvasStore.svelte.ts
I see the issue! The `setupZeroSubscription()` is called at the module level (line 249), which happens when the module is first imported. This is before the canvas manager has a chance to disable Zero.

Let me fix this by deferring the Zero subscription setup:
Now I need to add the conditional setup after checking for canvas manager. Let me find where the loadState function is called:
Read file: src/lib/stores/canvasStore.svelte.ts
Perfect! I can see that the module initialization code already checks for canvas manager presence. Now I need to update this code to also set up the Zero subscription conditionally:
Now let me also add a method to the canvasStore that allows setting up Zero subscription manually if needed:
Now let me refresh the browser to test if the issue is resolved. Let me also check the browser console output by opening the browser automation tool:
Ran tool
I'll help you fix the remaining issue where Zero is still loading its data despite being disabled. Let me check the browser console to see what's happening:
Ran tool
I can see the issue! Even though the canvas manager is disabling Zero adapter, Zero is still starting up and initializing before the canvas manager gets a chance to disable it. The logs show:

1. Zero starts up first (WARNING: Zero starting up with no server URL)
2. Then canvas manager initializes and disables Zero
3. But Zero is already running in the background

Let me check how Zero is being initialized:
Ran tool
I found the issue! The problem is in `zeroStore.ts` at line 133-135. Zero is being initialized at the module level, which happens as soon as the module is imported. This initialization happens before the canvas manager has a chance to disable it.

Let me fix this by preventing Zero from initializing when canvas manager is present:
Now I also need to prevent the Zero client from starting up at all when canvas manager is present. Let me modify the Zero initialization:
Now I need to update the ZeroQueries and ZeroMutators classes to handle the case where zero is null:
Now let me update ZeroMutators to handle null zero client:
Now let me also update the canvasZeroAdapter to handle the case where Zero queries return null:
Now let me refresh the browser to see if the issue is resolved:
Ran tool
I'll check the browser console to see if the Zero initialization issue is resolved:
Ran tool
Great! The Zero initialization issue is fixed. The console shows:

- Zero client is not created when canvas manager is detected
- Zero initialization is skipped
- Canvas store skips Zero subscription

Now let me check if the artwork gallery is properly displayed by taking a screenshot:
Ran tool
I can see the canvas is now properly showing the artwork gallery! The Zero initialization issue has been successfully resolved. Let me take a screenshot to confirm the visual state:
