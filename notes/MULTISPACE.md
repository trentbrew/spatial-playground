i notice that the canvas shows up for a second, and then the nodes from local storage are immediately loaded in...

This feels like a good time to go ahead and implement a system for managing multiple canvases. The gallery can be the default, and we can give the user the option to create a new blank canvas containing a single welcome note.

I'd like for this canvas management menu to live in the upper right, replacing the scene stats dropdown, but visially similar. The "Scene Stats" label should be replaced with the name of the canvas we're currently viewing.
